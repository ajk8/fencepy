Standardized fencing off of python virtual environments on a per-project
basis. The idea is to take a directory as an input and create and manage
a python virtual environment in a known location.

This has proven to be an unstable build environment. Keeping it here for
ease of checking up on the status manually.

How does it work?
-----------------

`fencepy` is fairly simple. After parsing arguments, it calls out to the
correct copy of `virtualenv` (based on the location of the running python
interpreter) with a pre-generated base directory. Upon successful creation
of the virtual environment, it applies various modifications based on the
contents of the directory from which it was run.

Opinionated hooks
-----------------

The goal is to make this framework attractive to users of other
compatible products. For instance, as a user of git and sublime text, I
added functionality related to those.

git
~~~

If the directory provided as input (defaults to cwd) is part of a git
repository, the virtual environment created will be relative to the root
of that repository.

sublime text
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sublime linter plugin is very easy to configure. Pointing it to a
particular installation of python is as simple as putting some json into
a configuration file. If there is a ``.sublime-project`` file in the
input directory, then it will be configured to respect the virtual
environment that is being created.

requirements.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a helpful shortcut, if there is a ``requirements.txt`` file in the
input directory, then those requirements will be installed upon
virtualenv creation.

oh-my-zsh
~~~~~~~~~

If you use ``oh-my-zsh``, when you set up your first fencepy environment, it will
configure some shortcuts for you::

    fpadd -> fencepy create
    fpnew -> fencepy create
    fpsrc -> . `fencepy activate`
    fpup  -> fencepy update
    fpdel -> fencepy erase

Usage
-----

``fencepy create``: Create a new virtual environment

``. `fencepy activate```: Activate the virtual environment in a bash-like shell

``source (fencepy activate)``: Activate the virtual environment in fish shell

``. $(fencepy activate)``: Activate the virtual environment in windows powershell

``fencepy update``: Re-run all plugins on an existing fencepy

``fencepy erase``: Remove the virtual environment

``fencepy nuke``: Remove all of fencepy's virtual environments (for the obsessive cleaners out there)

``fencepy genconfig``: Create a config file with defaults in fencepy's root directory

``fencepy help``: Get help on these and other optional arguments

Additional notes
----------------

Python versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both python 2 and 3 are supported. Additionally, both can be used for
one project, as they will be stored in separate directories.

Cross-platform support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Windows and UNIX shells are supported! I have not yet figured out how
to activate in one command from within CMD.exe. If anyone knows the solution,
please let me know!

Extending fencepy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional functionality should be very easy to implement. Each of the hooks
mentioned above is implemented as a "plugin" that takes the full dict of parsed
arguments as input. Additionally, inverse cleanup methods are planned for the
future.
